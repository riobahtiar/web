# Getting Started with Astro

Astro is a modern static site generator that allows you to build lightning-fast websites using your favorite JavaScript frameworks while shipping zero JavaScript by default.

## Why Astro?

Astro stands out from other static site generators for several reasons:

1. **Component Islands**: Use React, Vue, Svelte, or any other framework components where needed
2. **Zero JavaScript by Default**: Ship no JavaScript to the client unless necessary
3. **Excellent Developer Experience**: Hot module reloading, TypeScript support, and more
4. **Powerful Content Collections**: First-class support for content management

## Setting Up Your First Astro Project

Getting started with Astro is straightforward. Here's how:

```bash
# Create a new project with npm
npm create astro@latest

# Or with pnpm
pnpm create astro@latest

# Or with yarn
yarn create astro
```

## Project Structure

A typical Astro project structure looks like this:

```
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── layouts/
│   ├── pages/
│   └── styles/
├── public/
├── astro.config.mjs
└── package.json
```

## Building Pages

In Astro, pages can be created using `.astro`, `.md`, `.mdx`, or even `.html` files:

```astro
---
// src/pages/index.astro
---

<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>My Astro Site</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to Astro!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Using Components

Astro components are powerful and flexible:

```astro
---
// src/components/Card.astro
interface Props {
  title: string;
  body: string;
}

const { title, body } = Astro.props;
---

<div class="card">
  <h2>{title}</h2>
  <p>{body}</p>
</div>

<style>
  .card {
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    padding: 1rem;
    border-radius: 0.5rem;
  }
</style>
```
